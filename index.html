        <p class="description"> 
        I'm a Lithuanian living in Birmingham. I grew up in a  creative family surrounded by art books and plants in every corner of our tiny house. Arts, crafts and creative projects are part of my life and my favourite thing to do during my free time. Last few years I make macrame plant hangers, wall hangings and accessories from the recycled cotton cord. For me, macrame is a form of meditation and a great way to relax. Also, I love to go outdoors and spend time in nature.

        <p class="description"> 
        Over the years technologies, software and apps became part of my life and I started gaining more interest in them and how they work. I don't have any previous experience in coding but always wanted to try this field. I love technologies and constantly learning new things and I believe, that now is the perfect time to take the next step and change my career path. The Tech industry is such a wide sector full of different opportunities. I would love to find my way in this industry, to connect my creativity and attention to detail.
